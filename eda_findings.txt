Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings
Dataset: House Price India

1. Dataset Overview
- Total records: 14,619
- Total features: 23
- Target variable: Price
- Data quality: Clean dataset with no missing values
- Data types: Mix of numerical and categorical variables

2. Price Distribution
- House prices show a right-skewed distribution.
- Majority of properties fall within the mid-price range.
- A small number of properties are extremely expensive, indicating the presence of high-value luxury homes.
- These high values are realistic and not data errors.

3. Key Factors Influencing House Prices
Strong Positive Influence:
- Living Area: Larger living spaces significantly increase house prices.
- Number of Bathrooms: Stronger impact on price than number of bedrooms.
- Waterfront: Houses with waterfront access are priced much higher.
- View: Houses with better views command premium prices.
- Renovated Living Area: Renovated homes have higher market value.

Moderate Influence:
- Number of Bedrooms
- Lot Area
- House Condition
- Built Year (newer houses tend to be more expensive)

Weak / Negative Influence:
- Distance from Airport: Greater distance reduces price.
- Renovation Year = 0 (not renovated) lowers property value.
- Older houses generally sell at lower prices.

4. Outlier Analysis
- Outliers detected mainly in Price, Living Area, and Lot Area.
- These outliers represent luxury properties.
- Recommended handling method: capping (winsorization) instead of removal.

5. Correlation Insights
- Price has strong correlation with:
  - Living Area
  - Bathrooms
  - Waterfront
  - View
- Low multicollinearity observed among features, making the dataset suitable for regression models.

6. Business Insights
- Renovation significantly improves resale value.
- Waterfront and scenic view properties generate higher returns.
- Larger homes with modern facilities are more profitable.
- Location and amenities play a crucial role in pricing.

7. Conclusion
- The dataset is well-structured, clean, and analysis-ready.
- Ideal for price prediction models and real estate market analysis.
